# Hyperparameter-tuning
intro to hyperparameter tuning
The code challenge focuses on hyperparameter tuning for a classification problem using the Wine Quality dataset. It preprocesses the data by converting quality labels into binary labels, standardizing features, filling NaN values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. The code then trains a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model on the preprocessed data and defines a custom log-loss scoring function to evaluate the model's performance. Finally, it conducts hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the SVC's hyperparameters and improve the model's predictive capabilities for wine quality classification.
